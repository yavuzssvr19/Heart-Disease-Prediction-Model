## Heart Disease Prediction Model with Machine Learning

Welcome to my journey exploring the potential of machine learning models at the intersection of health technology and artificial intelligence. In this project, I tried to implement a model that can predict whether individuals have heart disease based on their medical characteristics, using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries.

## 📊 Data
To train our model, I used an existing dataset on Kaggle that includes various medical characteristics of patients such as age, gender, type of chest pain, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol.

## 🔍 Features
The features in the dataset are based on patients' medical history and physiological test results. These characteristics include important health indicators such as age, gender, type of chest pain, resting blood pressure and maximum heart rate.

## 📐 Modeling
Using the algorithm selection scheme of the scikit-learn library, I selected the most appropriate machine learning model for my project. In the process, I compared various classification algorithms and identified the model that performed best in predicting heart disease.

## 🧪 Experiment
I made various hyperparameter adjustments and model improvements to improve the model's performance and make more accurate predictions. This process involves a continuous cycle of experimentation and improvement.
